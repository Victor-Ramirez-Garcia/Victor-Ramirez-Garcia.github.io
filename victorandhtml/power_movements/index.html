			<h1 id='movementName'>Yellow Power: Asian American Movement</h1>
			<p id="summary" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
				In the  late 1960s,  large numbers of Asian Americans, particularly  college students, began to 
				protest a long history of discrimination. Since the 1850s, racism directed at Asians led to laws 
				limiting  Asian  immigration  to  the  U.S.,  prohibiting  marriage  between  whites  and  Asians,  restricting ownership of property, and enforcing school segregation. In addition to these laws,  Japanese Americans were placed in interment camps during World War II because they were 
				considered a national threat.
				<br> 
				<br>
				Inspired by the &ldquo;Black Power&rdquo; and the civil rights movement, Asian Americans organized in the 
				1960s to change their status in society. They called for Asian studies programs in colleges, the 
				development of a united  Asian&dash;American  community,  and  an  end  to  racism,  especially 
				negative stereotyping of Asians in the media.
			</p>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="font-size: 3vh;">Key Successes:</h2>			
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					Successfully used marches and demonstrations to persuade officials to develop Asian 
					studies programs on college campuses.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					Established numerous programs to serve Asian&dash;American communities.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					Raised awareness about the need to establish a common Asian&dash;American identity.
				</li>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="margin-top: 1vh; font-size: 3vh;">Shortcomings:</h2>
	
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					Many Asian Americans still continue to face discrimination in American society.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					Groups of differing Asian heritage have had difficulty uniting for a common cause.
				</li>
				
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					Some Asian Americans have had difficulty advancing in society because many Americans 
					view Asian Americans as a single group and a &ldquo;model minority&rdquo; &dash; one that has succeeded in 
					spite of enormous obstacles &dash; that does not require assistance or support.

			<h1 id='movementName'>Black Power: SNCC &amp; the Black Panthers</h1>
			<p id="summary">
				In 1966, two key civil rights organizations&dash;SNCC and Black Panthers&dash;embraced Black Power. 
				Stokely Carmichael was elected chairman of SNCC and proceeded to transform SNCC from an 
				inter&dash;racial  organization  committed  to  nonviolence  and  integration  into  an  all&dash;black 
				organization  that  was  committed  to  bringing  political  and  economic  power  to  African 
				Americans.  Carmichael  called  on  blacks  to  form  their  own separate  political  organizations,  elect  black  political  leaders,  supporting  black&dash;owned  businesses,  and  use  violence  against 
				whites if necessary. Carmichael rejected white values of style, adopted the slogan of &ldquo;Black is 
				Beautiful,&rdquo; and supported the wearing of Afro hairstyles and African forms of dress. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The Black Panther Party for Self&dash;Defense was founded in Oakland, California by activists Huey 
				Newton  and  Bobby  Seale.  The  two  college&dash;educated  activists  were  frustrated  with  the 
				mainstream  civil rights movements  emphasis  on  integration  and  nonviolence.  They  argued 
				that  the  movement  was  ineffective,  and  that  it  had  failed  to  relieve  the  poverty  and 
				powerlessness  faced  by  many  urban  blacks.  They  founded  the  organization  in  response  to 
				what  the  black  community  perceived  as  systematic  harassment  and  brutality  by  the 
				predominately white Oakland Police Force. Arming themselves for self&dash;defense, the Panthers 
				followed police officers and monitored their actions. The Black Panthers created programs to 
				help cure the social and economic ills afflicting African Americans in Oakland.
			</p>

			<h2 id="keyPoints">Key Successes:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Established a school breakfast program for children in Oakland that served as many as 200 
					children a day.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Created adult education classes to increase literacy rates among black adults.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Started a summer school program for Oakland youth promoting black pride and self&dash;esteem.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Raised awareness about the issue of police brutality through their neighborhood patrols.
				</li>
			
			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="margin-top: 1vh;">Shortcomings:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint">
					The Panthers open display of firearms provoked the FBIs Counter&dash;Intelligence Program to 
					&ldquo;expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit or otherwise neutralize&rdquo; the Black Panthers; the FBI 
					was involved in forging leaflets, posters and correspondence to discredit the group.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Oakland Police raids on Panther offices resulted in the arrests and shooting deaths of 
					several members.
				</li>
					
				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Panthers were unable to sustain a following or raise the funds necessary to transform their 
					revolutionary ideas into a larger, more successful political movement.

			<h1 id='movementName' style="font-size: 2.5vh;">Brown Power: Chicanos, Cesar Chavez, &amp; the United Farm Workers</h1>
			<p id="summary" style="font-size: 2vh;">
				In the early 1960s, Cesar Chavez began mobilizing migrant farm laborers, particularly Mexican 
				and Mexican American farm workers, to speak out against decades of exploitation. Chavez was 
				a former migrant worker who established a union called the United Farm Workers (UFW) and 
				organized  nonviolent  protests  against  the  low  wages,  unsafe  working  conditions,  and  long 
				hours  typical  in  migrant  farm  labor.  He  organized  boycotts  against  growers  for  whom  the 
				laborers  worked.  By  1970,  he  had successfully  won recognition  of the UFW by most  of the 
				growers in California.
				<br>
				<br>
				Additionally, a wide array of organizations were created the 1960s and 70s that tried to better 
				the lives of Mexican Americans. These organizations were made up primarily of either youth 
				on  college  campuses  or  those  living  in  urban  neighborhoods  of  the  American  southwest.
				Mexican&dash;American groups embraced the terms &ldquo;Chicano&rdquo; (Mexicano) and &ldquo;La Raza&rdquo; (the race)
				to emphasize pride in their Mexican heritage.
			</p>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="font-size: 2.5vh;">Key Successes:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					The two&dash;year boycott of by the UFW resulted in most grape growers in California signing 
					contracts recognizing the UFW union and its right to collectively bargain for its members.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Unionization led to higher pay and better, safer working conditions for many farm workers.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					The UFW achieved long&dash;lasting prominence as a political organization, gaining support from 
					church groups, other unions and political leaders like Robert Kennedy.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Chicano youth organizations contributed to growing racial pride and unity in the Mexican&dash;
					American community.
				</li>
			
			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="margin-top: 1vh; font-size: 2.5vh;">Shortcomings:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					The vast majority of farm workers remained unaffiliated and unrepresented.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Farm worker wages remain low and working conditions poor overall.
				</li>
					
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Most farm workers continue to suffer inadequate housing and miserable living conditions.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Mexican Americans remained underrepresented on college campuses.
				</li>

			<h1 id='movementName'>Rainbow Power: The Gay Liberation Movement</h1>
			<p id="summary">
				Before the late 1960s, most homosexuals were quiet about their sexual orientation for fear of 
				losing  jobs,  friends, and  families.  In  the early  1970s,  the  gay  community  became  an 
				increasingly  vocal  force  fighting  for  civil  rights  and  societal  acceptance.  The  gay  liberation 
				movement started most notably in 1969 when hundreds of gay men and lesbians in New York 
				City protested decades of police harassment of homosexuals and the arrest of several gay men 
				after a police raid at the Stonewall Inn (a gay nightclub). These &ldquo;Stonewall riots&rdquo; led to a major 
				shift in attitudes among gay and lesbian Americans, who began to demand equal rights and 
				societal acceptance.
				<br>
				<br>
				&ldquo;Gay  Pride&rdquo;  demonstrations  and  parades  were  held  in  major  cities,  and  a  newspaper,  The 
				Advocate, promoted gay rights issues. Millions of gays and lesbians &ldquo;came out of the closet&rdquo; 
				and  openly  declared  their  sexual  preference.  The  Gay  Liberation  Front  (GLF)  worked  to 
				convince Americans that  homosexuals  are not  dangerous sexual  deviants but rather people 
				who deserved equal rights and recognition.
			</p>

			<h2 id="keyPoints">Key Successes:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Raised awareness of violence against homosexuals, ended police raids on gay bars, and 
					helped American society become more open and accepting of homosexuality, as 
					demonstrated by the number of gay and lesbian characters in television and film.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint">
					In 1977, the gay community made a breakthrough when Harvey Milk, an openly gay man, 
					was elected to the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco, California. Since the late 1970s, 
					numerous openly gay politicians have been elected.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint">
					In 1998, 313 companies, including Disney and IBM, extended health and retirement 
					benefits to &ldquo;domestic partners&rdquo; of gay and lesbian employees.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Gay rights advocates have successfully lobbied for funding for AIDS research.
				</li>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="margin-top: 1vh;">Shortcomings:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint">
					The Non&dash;Discrimination Act, a law outlawing discrimination in the workplace based on 
					sexual preference, failed to pass in Congress in 1997.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Gay and lesbian marriages are only recognized in a few states and many states have passed 
					laws officially prohibiting same&dash;sex marriages.
				</li>
					
				<li id="bulletPoint">
					Laws regarding gay and lesbian adoptions remain restrictive, and such adoptions are 
					permitted in only 13 states.
				</li>

			<h1 id='movementName'>Red Power: The Native American Movement</h1>
			<p id="summary" style="font-size: 2vh;">
				Inspired by the African American civil rights movement, Native Americans organized the &ldquo;Red 
				Power&rdquo; movement  to seek  their  own  civil  rights.  By  the 1960s,  American Indians  had  the 
				lowest  income,  worst  health,  highest  suicide  rate,  shortest  life  expectancy  and  highest 
				unemployment rate of any minority group in the United States. Native American activists tried
				to draw attention to these conditions by suing the federal government and organizing protest 
				marches to demand Indian autonomy and the return of Indian lands lost because of broken 
				treaties. In 1969, 78 Indians occupied Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay; in 1972 the militant 
				American Indian Movement (AIM) occupied the Bureau of Indian Affairs  in Washington, DC; 
				and in 1973, 200 armed AIM members took  control of Wounded Knee in South Dakota, the 
				site  of  the  1890  massacre  of  Indians.  In  each  of  these  protests,  American  Indians  brought 
				attention to their cause. 
			</p>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="font-size: 2.5vh;">Key Successes:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Congress approved $510 million for Indian aid programs in 1968.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Through legal battles, Native Americans won back 7 million acres of former Indians lands in 
					South Dakota and 1,800 acres in Rhode Island.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Indians have been appointed to top positions at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Congress passes the Indian Self&dash;Determination and Education Act in 1975, giving Indians 
					more say in their reservations and their education. Federal support was obtained for 
					curriculum in Indian schools that stresses tribal history and heritage.
				</li>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="margin-top: 1vh; font-size: 2.5vh;">Shortcomings:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Most Native Americans continue to live in poor conditions on Indian reservations.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Alcoholism, suicide, poor health and sanitary conditions and high unemployment continue 
					to plague the Native&dash;American population.
				</li>
					
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					The armed occupations at Alcatraz, Washington DC, and Wounded Knee were unsuccessful 
					in obtaining land and ended in property damage, the deaths of two Indians, numerous 
					arrests, and divisiveness within the Native&dash;American community.

			<h1 id='movementName'>Pink Power: The Womens Movement</h1>
			<p id="summary" style="font-size: 2vh;">
				In  1966,  Betty  Friedan  published  The  Feminine  Mystique which  argued  that  the  American 
				home had become a  &ldquo;comfortable  concentration  camp&rdquo; for women who were pressured by 
				society to be  &ldquo;happily  content  in a world of bedroom,  kitchen, sex, babies, and home.&rdquo; The 
				book  launched the  womens  movement  in  America.  Betty  Freidan  co&dash;founded the National 
				Organization for Women (NOW), which became an important venue for bringing attention to 
				womens  issues. Feminists  drew  attention  to  the  lack  of  rights  for  women  and  demanded 
				improved education, job opportunities, healthcare, childcare facilities, legal and safe abortion, 
				and shared parenting (greater emphasis on fathers roles in bringing up children).  In the 1960s
				and  1970s,  feminists  called  for  the  passage  of  an  Equal  Rights  Amendment  (ERA)  to  the 
				Constitution which would ban discrimination on the basis of sex. Friedan and Gloria Steinem
				(editor of the feminist&dash;themed Ms. magazine) actively campaigned for the ERA.
			</p>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="font-size: 3vh;">Key Successes:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.1vh;">
					Succeeded in raising awareness of womens unequal status in American society
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.1vh;">
					Congress passed Title VII to protect women against sexual harassment and discrimination 
					because of pregnancy or disability.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.1vh;">
					Congress passed Title IX to protect womens athletic programs and to outlaw discrimination 
					in educational programs that received federal money.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.1vh;">
					The Supreme Court ruled in the 1973 Roe v Wade case that states could not make it illegal 
					for women to have an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy.
				</li>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="margin-top: 1vh; font-size: 3vh;">Shortcomings:</h2>
			
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.1vh;">
					The ERA was never passed. Though approved by Congress in 1972 and ratified by 22 states, 
					the ERA died 3 states short of passage in 1982.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.1vh;">
					Women continue to face discrimination and sexual harassment in many areas of 
					employment and are still not paid the same as men for equal work.
				</li>
					
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.1vh;">
					Government sponsored childcare was never established.

			<h1 id='movementName'>Green Power: The Environmental Movement</h1>
			<p id="summary" style="font-size: 2.3vh;">
				In 1962, biologist Rachel Carson published the book Silent Spring that exposed the dangers of 
				using  pesticides, specifically DDT,  on the  environment  and the  ecosystem.  She  had  become 
				concerned  during the  1950s  at the rapid  increase  in  pesticides  by farmers  and  government 
				agencies.  Reaction  to  her  book  led  the  government  to  organize  an  investigation  of  the 
				industry and sparked the  environmental  movement. In  1970, the  government  created the 
				Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) The United States also passed new legislation such as 
				the  Clean  Water  Act,  the  Clean  Air  Act,  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  and  the  National 
				Environmental Policy Act&dash; the foundations for current environmental standards.
			</p>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="font-size: 2.5vh;">Key Successes:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.3vh;">
					The public has become more aware of environmental issues, such as air, water, and noise
					pollution, solid waste disposal, dwindling energy resources, radiation, pesticide poisoning.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.3vh;">
					Americans celebrate Earth Day each year on April 22 to bring awareness to environmental 
					concerns and emphasize the slogan: &ldquo;think globally, act locally.&rdquo;
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.3vh;">
					New technologies such as bio&dash;fuels and alternative energies are being invented to combat 
					environmental and energy shortages.
				</li>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="margin-top: 1vh; font-size: 2.5vh;">Shortcomings:</h2>
			
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.3vh;">
					The United States remain the most oil dependent country in the world.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.3vh;">
					Numerous issues continue to threaten the global environment, such as global warming, 
					depleted natural resources such as oil, air and water pollution (especially among 
					developing nations), growing numbers of endangered or extinct plants and animals.

			<h1 id='movementName'>Disability Rights Movement</h1>
			<p id="summary" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
				By the 1960s, the civil rights movement began to take shape, and disability advocates saw the opportunity to join forces alongside other minority groups to demand equal treatment, equal access and equal opportunity for people with disabilities. The struggle for disability rights has followed a similar pattern to many other civil rights movements&dash;challenging negative attitudes and stereotypes, rallying for political and institutional change, and lobbying for the self&dash;determination of a minority community.

				In the 1970s, disability rights activists lobbied Congress and marched on Washington to include civil rights language for people with disabilities into the 1972 Rehabilitation Act. In 1973, the Rehabilitation Act was passed, and for the first time in history, civil rights of people with disabilities were protected by law.

			</p>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="font-size: 3vh;">Key Successes:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					The first handicap parking sticker had been created (Washington DC, 1973).
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					The first legal advocacy center, The National Center for Law and the Handicapped, was founded at the University of Notre Dame.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					In 1975, The American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities was founded, the first disability rights group that was created, governed and administered by disabled individuals.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					The 1975 Education of All Handicapped Children Act guaranteed children with disabilities the right to public school education.
				</li>

			<h2 id="keyPoints" style="margin-top: 1vh; font-size: 3vh;">Shortcomings:</h2>
				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					Deinstitutionalization of people with disabilities was a slow process constantly faced with bureaucratic hurdles and discrimination from society.
				</li>

				<li id="bulletPoint" style="font-size: 2.2vh;">
					Bills were difficult to pass through Congress because of budget constraints and/or political lack of will.
