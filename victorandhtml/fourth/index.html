				Definition: The right of the people to be secure in their personal privacy against &quot;unreasonable&quot; searches and seizures, shall not be violated without a Warrant. The idea is that to avoid the evils of general warrants, each search or seizure should be cleared in advance by a judge, and that to get a warrant the government must show &quot;probable cause&quot; &#8211; a certain level of suspicion of criminal activity.

				As you can see on screen, this is an example of the police violating the 4th amendment rule of the constitution because he did not get a warrant or had any &quot;probable cause&quot; to search the residents house.

				<h1 id="exampleTitle">Adams v. Williams<br>(Apr 10, 1972 - Jun 12, 1972):</h1>
				<h3 id="exampleText" style="font-size: 2vh;">
					Brief Summary(Scene happened during the early morning hours of October 30, 1966):
					<br>
					<br>
					An indiviadual approached police officer Frederick E. Adams and informed him that an indivual in a nearby vehicle was carrying narcotics and had a gun at his waist. Adams then approached the vehicle, reached into the car, and removed a gun from Williams waistband once he got told to rolled down the window. Police Officer Frederick E. Adams then arrested Robert Williams for unlawful possession of a firearm and proceeded to search the vehicle, where he found heroin. The Supreme Court of Connecticut affirmed the conviction of Williams for possession of a handgun and heroin, which Williams later then filed a claim against Adams that the state of Connecticut continued to detain him unlawfully as a prisoner through an unlawful search and should not use the handgun and drugs into evidence at his trial.
					<br>
					<br>
					Court Decision:
					<br>
					<br>
					Robert Williams was then ordered to let his conviction be set aside by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
					Second Circuit. On the contrary, in a 6-3 majority in the Burger Court, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment
					allows a police officer, acting only on a tip of an informant, to approach a person and remove a weapon concealed
					in the person's waistband.

					Summary:
					<br>
					<br>
					Federal Agents attached an eavesdropping device to the outside of a public phone booth used by Katz
					on a hunch that Katz was transmitting gambling information over the phone to clients in other
					states. After hearing the recording of the conversations, Katz was convicted under an eight-count indictment for the illegal transmission of wagering information from Los Angeles to Boston and Miami. Kats then challenged stating that the recordings
					could not be used as evidence against him which the Court of Appeals denied his appeal, but granted certiorari, an order by which a higher court reviews a decision of a lower court.
					<br>
					<br>
					Court Decision:
					<br>
					<br>
					In a 7-to-1 majority in the Warren Court, the Court held that the United States violated Katz Fourth Amendment by the unnecessary physical intrusion into the area he occupied and the protection of Katz conversations.

					Both James Edmond and Joell Palmer were stopped at one of the City of Indianapolis narcotics checkpoints that conducts

					Court Decision:
					<br>
					<br>
					The District Court rejected the request for a preliminary injuction, but in a 6-3 majority in the Rehnquist Court,

				<h1 id="exampleTitle">Arizona v. Johnson<br>(Dec 9, 2008 - Jan 26, 2009):</h1>
				<h3 id="exampleText" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
					Summary:
					<br>
					<br>
					Lemon Johnson was riding in the backseat of a car when it was pulled over by the state police in Sugar Hill, Arizona because the license of the car had a &quot;mandatory insurance suspension&quot;. The police started to question about the car&rsquo;s occupants and Johnson about gang activity in the area even though the stop was only for the suspended license. From there, Johnson voluntarily exited the car to be question further by the police. When Johnson exited the car, the police then did a subsequent search were they found a handgun and a small amount of marijuana. Johnson was then convicted in Arizona State court for unlawful possession of a weapon as a prohibited possessor and possession of marijuana. Johnson then appealed arguing that the evidence should not be used because the officers did not have probable cause to search him at the time of his arrest which is a violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.
					<br>
					<br>
					Court Decision:
					<br>
					<br>
					The Court of Appeals of Arizona granted to reversed his conviction and his sentence because the officers has no reason to believe that Johnson was involved in any criminal activity when he was searched, therefore the officers subsequent search of Johnson was illegal and unconstitutional. On reverse, in a unanimous majority in the Roberts Court, the police may lawfully search an individual during a routine traffic stop if they believe him to be armed and dangerous, even if they had no reason to  believe he was involved in criminal activity when he was searched.

		<div id="myOpinion">
			<h1 id="opinionTitle">What do I think about the Fourth Amendment?</h1>
			<h3 id="opinionText" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
				I think the Fourth Amendment is strong enough because everything is already in place, it&rsquo;s just that there are gaps that haven&rsquo;t been filled in yet. 
				<br>
				<br>
				For example, there is no answer to a &quot;reasonable&quot; or an &quot;unreasonable&quot; search and seizure which is very conserning.
