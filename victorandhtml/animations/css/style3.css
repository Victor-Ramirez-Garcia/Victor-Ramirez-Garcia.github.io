I gave the background a gradient with the size of 200% for the animation

and it will repeat itselfafter it goes back to the left position
so thats why you can see the gradient move from left to right

You cant see it but its important

I added a flex display to be centered
with a height of 100% so that it is centered

because the h1 tag moves the animation down*/

the animation name is called gradients2
the whole animation is five seconds
