                I am a seventeen year old student who has roughly 3 years of computer science
                and am familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Throughout the years learning 
                computer science, I have created finished and unfinished projects including
                the 3 games and the website that you have seen.
            </p>

            <p id="paragraph">
                When making these types of games or websites, I have to come up with a bunch of various
                ways to execute it, when you start your project everything goes out smoothly.
                I have to keep in mind before I start making any of these projects, theres always
                a sketch to know how my game/website is going to look like and types of block code im going
                to use.
            </p>

            <p id='paragraph'>
                I hope to continue creating projects in the future with other programming languages to
                have a wider branch of web development.
            </p>

                Sincerely,
                <br>
